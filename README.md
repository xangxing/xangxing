Learning Smart Contract From Scratch.
Introduction of Smart Contracts.
Smart Contract is the fundamental building blocks of Ethereum applications.They are computer programs stored on the blockchain that allowas us to convert traditional contracts into digital parelles. Smart contracts behave exactly as programmed and cannot be changed.
It was Nick Szabo, who coined the term "Smart Contract." He envisioned a digital marketplace built on these automatic, cryptographicall secure processes. An place where transactions and business functions can happen trustlessly â€“ without intermediaries. Smart contracts on Ethereum put this vision into practice.
